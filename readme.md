# Event Management in JavaScript

Examples of event handling in JavaScript.

## Usage

To run the examples, you need a local development server. It needs to access JavaScript modules which don't serve when accessing the `.html` via the `file` protocol.

## Examples

- [Toggle colors](./toggle/index.html) Trivial example that toggles the background color of a div between blue and red
- [Toggle visibility](./visibility/index.html) toggles visibility of an object.
